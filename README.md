# EKF and AMCL SLAM for Differential Drive Robot

This repository contains code to generate a map using SLAM, and perform robust localization using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) combined with Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) in ROS2.

The implementation integrates motion control, sensor feedback, and state estimation to enable a mobile robot to navigate unknown environments and localize itself within a map.

## Features

- Real-time mapping using ROS2 SLAM  
- Pose estimation using an EKF for sensor fusion  
- Localization on a known map using AMCL  
- ROS2 launch files to orchestrate mapping and localization workflows
